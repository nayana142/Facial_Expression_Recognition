    Automatic facial expression recognition (FER) has gained much attention due to its applications in human-computer interaction.
    Among the approaches to improve FER tasks, this paper focuses on deep architecture with the attention mechanism.

## About Dataset
    * The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face
    is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. 
    * The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories 
    (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the 
    public test set consists of 3,589 examples.
